I re-create an extension idea of P'Benz. The concept is to making the [**item market**](https://astronize.com/th/market) is show detail in the market place itself.

So I try to making and developing the code until it's work.

if you want to try the extension here [My github](https://github.com/Tnanawat666/chrome_extensions.git)

1. clone or down a zip file.
2. extract.
3. go to browser setting > extension.
4. turn on developer mode.
5. import the folder to the browser.
6. use it on [**game market**](https://astronize.com/th/market)
